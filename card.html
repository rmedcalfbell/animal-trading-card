			<p>The Sea Otter is an endangered species with population numbers decreasing - which is remarkable as its only natural predators are Humans, Great White Sharks and Killer Whales. Although the Sea Otter consumes 25% of its body weight in food everyday it is still the only marine mammal which has no blubber layer! The Sea Otter uses tools to crack open shellfish, and has the densest coat of fur in all of the animal kingdom! </p>
